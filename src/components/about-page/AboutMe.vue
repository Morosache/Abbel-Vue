            <p>
                I am Guriță Eduard Abbel, and although I work in construction, my true passion is photography. I love
                capturing people in nature and preserving special moments in their lives: weddings, baptisms, and
                important events.
            </p>
            <p>
                It all started with a high-performance phone, when I used to take pictures of my friends. I discovered
                that photography relaxes me and makes me happy. Soon, encouraged by friends, I bought my first camera
                and began doing photo sessions for people I knew. My first paid experience helped me gain confidence and
                understand that my passion can bring joy to others as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, I have invested in professional equipment and have had the chance to be beside people during
                some of the most beautiful moments of their lives. Photography is not just work for me; it is a way to
                tell stories and create unforgettable memories.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a personal level, photography also changed my life: I met my wife, Lavinia, at a wedding where I was
                the photographer and she was a guest. Today, we are married and have two wonderful children together,
                Miriam and Isaac.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion for photography not only brings me professional satisfaction, but it also brought me personal
                happiness – and for that, I thank God every day.
